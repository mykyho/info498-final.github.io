                In the ever-evolving landscape of technology, it’s imperative to acknowledge the 
                complex relationship between race and innovation. Technology has brought advancement 
                in improving healthcare, greater access to education, daily efficiency and more. 
                Despite its promises for progress, systemic issues of racial bias and inequity are 
                evident within its realms. This blog discusses the multifaceted dimensions of race in technology, 
                exploring the different aspects of where racial biases are prevalent and changes that may steer 
                technology away from biases and fostering an inclusive experience for all. 
              </p>

              <H3>Unpack History and Why Technology is the Way it is today</H3>
              <p style="text-indent: 25px;">
                It can be a surprise to think that modern day technology could be linked to the “pre-existing” 
                colonialism that practically expanded to the entire world. The intricate intersection of race and 
                technology, prevails in history and our everyday lives with daily human interactions.The adopted 
                terminology, “postcolonial” computing which is the overall ‘aftermath’ that refers to the condition, 
                “arises following the formal dismantling of colonial structures through national decolonization 
                struggles, namely the persistence of the colonial legacy in various cultural forms, practice, 
                histories and knowledges structures (Ali 2016, pg 18).” Although the ideas of colonial and 
                postcolonial computing is a relatively recent proposal, there is evidence of the lingering influence 
                still embedded in our society which influences production of technology.

              </p>
              
              <H3>Examples of technologies with racial bias</H3>
              <p>Listed below are some designs, algorithms and interfaces that affect user’s usability based on the 
                color of their skin.

                <li>
                  Automatic faucets have sensor systems that will automatically turn on water or dispense soap. 
                  In 2015 a video surfaced on YouTube demonstrating how the soap only dispensed soap for a 
                  light-skinned man versus a dark-skinned man. This incident shined lights on the clear case of 
                  racial biases in technology that was meant to be functional for all. The functionality of an 
                  automatic faucet and soap dispensers works by detecting a person’s hand with a beam. Darker skin 
                  reflects less light compared to light skin, so the sensor can fail to defect someone with darker 
                  skin color. There were discussions that faucets sold in India have been adjusted to work on 
                  darker-skinned users by decreasing signal reflected from the darker skin tone.
                </li>

                <li>
                  Apple is a known brand worldwide and every product that has hit the market has done exceptionally well.
                  Unfortunately, the Apple iWatch falls into the flop category. The iWatch’s sensor technology for pulse
                  monitoring failed on darker-skinned people. The sensor would also fail if the user had some shades of 
                  red or black tattoo on their arms. This resulted not only in the inaccurate pulse oximeter reading,
                  but affected the ability for user’s to use their Apple pay because the watch would think it lost contact 
                  with the user’s skin. There were suggestions that changing the sensors to use yellow light could help fix 
                  the issue. Apple has addressed the problems with tattoos, but has not commented on the racial implications.
                </li>

                <li>
                  In June of 2015, former Google intern Jacklyn Alcine tweeted about Flickr Google labeling Black people in their 
                  photo app as “ape” and “gorilla”. Google apologized about the situation, but excused the situation by saying,
                  “.. it is rather due to the way machines recognize faces or more specifically the way algorithms learn… Zunger 
                  elaborated that, in this case, the algorithm was fooled by some aspect of an image.” Through the statement it didn’t
                  seem like there was much effort on reengineering the way that the algorithm was learning, but stating it, “it takes time”
                  was extremely dismissive of the bigger picture.

                </li>
              </p>

              <H3>Lack of representation in Tech Industry</H3>
              <p style="text-indent: 25px;">
                Technology was never deemed to be perfect, but the implication to change the current culture and foster inclusiveness reside in 
                diversity and representation of the people other than those identifying as White. Incidents such as failed sensors that cannot 
                detect people with darker skin color would've been caught prior to the release of the product, but since that was news to both 
                user and the manufacturer itself, speaks volume on company culture and custom when testing their prototypes. Hiring more diverse 
                members to a design team not only targets underrepresented demographics and groups, but opens learning and working opportunities 
                for people of color.
              </p>
              
              <p style="text-indent: 25px;">
                Overall, I believe to achieve true equity in the tech industry does not end with “training”, but further including employees with 
                diverse backgrounds and amplifying their voices. Using their experience and skill set to help build technology for the people. 
                The tech industry should have a common goal - to strive towards a future where the color of your skin does not dictate your ability 
                to work, use a product or simply live your life in harmony. 
              </p>
